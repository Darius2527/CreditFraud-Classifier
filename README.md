# CreditFraud-Classifier
This project implements Artificial Neural Network ANN to classify valid and fake credit transaction. Firstly a 4 layer ANN model is created and trained using the ibalanced credit fraud dataset. And then the same model is trained with a balanced dataset created using SMOTETomek. Lastly a hyperparameter tuned ANN using kerastuner is created, and the model accuracies are compared
